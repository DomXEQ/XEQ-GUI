### Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

- Run `npm run format` to format code
- Run `npm run ready` to run both lint and format

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```

This commit adds the ability to register new service nodes directly
from the GUI wallet interface.
